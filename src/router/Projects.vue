          <strong> Project Details: </strong>
          AI COACH is a virtual therapist which can guide patients for the correct movements of an exercise in real-time.
          I have built this application from scratch and worked on a range of different sub-projects, i.e. Design UI, Handle
          API call, Design app flow, Manage software architecture (MVVM), Deploy Pose Detection models, develop and deploy
          Gesture Recognition models, Real-time Frame Processing, Implement graphical objects (i.e. angle, distance, texts, etc.)
          based on the real-time movements of a person, Manage AI COACH app in Apple's TestFlight.

          <strong> Project Details: </strong>
          I have implemented The android version of AI COACH to enhance the functionality of range-of-motion (ROM) of a person.
          Here, Background Segmentation model has been used to calculate the virtual heights and widths of different body parts,
          such as, shoulder to shoulder distance, toe to head distances, etc.

        <div>
          <strong> Project Details: </strong>
          The hand detection is a pre-requisite for detecting different hand gestures of a patient. Resnet50, MobileNet_V2,
          single shot detector (SSD) models have been combined and trained via transfer learning. Combination of COCO Hand,
          TV-Hand, and Ego-Hand datasets has been used to train the model.

          <strong> Project Details: </strong>
          This project aims to identify protein's post-translational modifications both individually and
          simultaneously with higher efficacy. We have developed three single label predictors such as
          Formyl_Pred, predPhogly-Site, and PredNitro which correspond to Formylation, Phosphoglycerylation,
          and Nitrotyrosine sites prediction separately, and two multi-label predictors, such as,
          predML-Site, and iMul-kSite for predicting Acetylation, Crotonylation, Methylation, Succinylation,
          and glutarylation sites simultaneously. More information could be found in the publications section.
