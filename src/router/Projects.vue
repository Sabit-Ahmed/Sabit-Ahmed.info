        <div>
          <strong> Project Details: </strong>
            A basic portfolio website built with Vue.js. The concept 'Single Page Application' (SPA) was implemented
            while playing around with this progressive JavaScript framework. Being a static website, the scope was 
            limited. But you could find out that your browser does not require any page reloading on this website.

          <strong> Project Details: </strong>
            A simple containerized CRUD application based on the Representational State Transfer (REST). 
            The first version included one single container and the later version included two separate 
            containers (i.e. API and database) with a shared network.

            Efficient Musculoskeletal Medical Assistant (EMMA) is a cross-platform application for 
            aiding AI driven musculoskeletal solutions. This stack consists of demo repositories, 
            such as deploying custom trained and converted models, face and pose detection models 
            with bare React-Native applications. The demo application below has been successfully 
            integrated with the official EMMA - LPT mobile app.

        <div>
          <strong> Project Details: </strong>
            This project aims to identify protein's post-translational modifications both individually and 
            simultaneously with higher efficacy. We have developed three single label predictors such as 
            Formyl_Pred, predPhogly-Site, and PredNitro which correspond to Formylation, Phosphoglycerylation,
             and Nitrotyrosine sites prediction separately, and two multi-label predictors, such as, 
             predML-Site, and iMul-kSite for predicting Acetylation, Crotonylation, Methylation, Succinylation,
              and glutarylation sites simultaneously. More information could be found in the publications section.
